# Tables-drawing-networking-app
Project 4

This project starts with a vc with a tableview. The tableview tells the user to choose how cool Ori is from 1-100. The next vc has the drawing stuff. It is a horizontal line in the middle of the screen that can be manipulated with sliders on the bottom to adjust the slope and y-intercept. This was pretty interesting to do because I had to combine skills I learned from the previous projects: I had to make the slider work but at the same time have it change the label and at the same time have it affect the drawing. I tried to do the talking to the web part and got pretty close, but I couldn't figure out. I was coding in swift so the code source on github didn't help me much :(

Day 1: created project and made minor tweaks
Day 2: did part 1 of the project: created first vc, tableview and it's settings
Day 3: did part 2 of the project: created sliders and buttons. Got the sliders to work with the drawing. Worked with draw function to manipulate the line.
Day 4: worked on the web aspect
Day 5: edited README
